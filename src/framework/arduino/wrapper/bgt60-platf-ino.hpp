 * @brief       Radar BGT60 platform definitions
 * @details     This file is defining the standard pins for the corresponding
 *              platform. Please make sure to connect your chosen board to pins
 *              mentioned here. Otherwise the functionality of the library can not
 *              be guaranteed. There is also the possibility to changes these pins
 *              either in this file or directly in the sketch. But make sure you're
 *              using the correct pins and in case you want to use the interrupt
 *              function, you also have to make sure the pins you chose are interrupt
 *              capable.
